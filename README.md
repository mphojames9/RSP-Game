# RSP-Game. The Odin Project Web Development.

Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project curriculum.

This is my first HTML/CSS/JS project.

Stage one | Browsing the game in console
I learnt the following from this stage.

How functions work with each other.
How to color the console text.
Enjoyed stylizing the prompt and console texts.
Game in the browser console

Stage two | Game with added UI
The benefits I got from this stage:

Learned to use and modify Font Awesome Icons.
knowledge of CSS transform and transition effects.
Learned basic manipulations of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).
Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (organization, workspaces, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones..).

# Summary
For a more playful experience, theme was changed to 'Fantasy' and name was changed to 'Wand Bow Mace'.
The game has a responsive layout with one breakpoint.
The game is fully playable in the browser windows
